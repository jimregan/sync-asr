AlignedSequence: a whole alignment pass (over timed or plain-text node
sequences) as a single, annotatable, comparable object -- and a pluggable
heuristic mechanism for bridging spans a base aligner left unresolved
with an accepted, named, non-destructive interpretation.

Reuses time_aligner.AlignedGroup as the unit of correspondence regardless
of domain (timing-based or text-based): `kind` is a free string, so a
text aligner can use edit-type vocabulary (cor/sub/ins/del/sil, matching
corpus-build's CTMEdit) while time_aligner.py keeps its own
(exact/overlap/unmatched_a/unmatched_b).
